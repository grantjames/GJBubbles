# GJBubbles
A JavaScript library to overlay a div with a canvas containing animated circles.

Demo: http://grantjames.github.io/gjbubbles/

I'm completely new to creating Javascript modules so please feel free to fork and submit a pull request to correct all my mistakes!

Todo:
* Add konami code listener to do something funky
* Ability to set bubble colours - pass in array of colours?
